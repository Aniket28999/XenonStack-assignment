**Solution:**

I Choose the _"Car Selling"_ Theme of my project. So I will be creating a webpage for selling cars.

**Project Title:** **CAR'S MARKET**

**Project Description:**

In this project of mine, For Frontend HTML, CSS, JavaScript have been used. For Backend Nodejs, Express have been used and for Database MongoDB has been used.

When you open the webpage you will see two options:

1. Register (First you'll have to register yourself to login to the webpage.)
2. Login (After register yourself, you can access the webpage for further information.)

After login, you'll see little bit about the cars which are in Queue for sale. There will be option of Contact US and Logout too.

If you choose "Contact US", a new page will be open in which, you will get the detailed form to fill for us to contact you. And if you click on logout, you'll get back to login page.
